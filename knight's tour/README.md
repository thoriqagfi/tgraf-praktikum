# Knight's Tour Problem

## Intro
A knight's tour involves a sequence of moves made by a knight on a chessboard, ensuring that each square is visited exactly once. If the knight finishes on a square reachable in one more knight's move from the starting point, it creates a closed tour; otherwise, it's an open tour.

We can solve the knight's tour problem using warnsdorff's algorithm, which states that:-

- We can start from any initial position of the knight on the board.
- We can always move to an adjacent, unvisited square with minimal degree(minimum number of unvisited adjacent).
